			<h1>population modeling with the logistic curve model</h1>

			<p> given dy/dt = ky(1-y/M), the logistics differential equation, general
					solution is y = M/(1 + be^(-Mkt)), where M is the carrying capacity, b
					is a constant that controls where the curve crosses the y axis, and a
					= M/(1+b), or the initial value/y-intercept.this can be applied to
					many contexts, especially in such as carrying capacity and initial
					population. given the variables, it is possible to solve for and graph
					this curve, which is what this website does. (NOTE: "past population"
					and "current population" refer to the less recent and more recent
					populations, respectively, not necessarily one from the past and the
					current one.)</p>
