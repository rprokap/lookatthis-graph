			<h1>Population Modeling With the Logistic Growth Model</h1>

			<p> Given dy/dt = ky(1-y/M), the logistics differential equation, general
					solution is y = M/(1 + be^(-Mkt)), where M is the carrying capacity, b
					is a constant that controls where the curve crosses the y axis, and a
					= M/(1+b), or the initial value/y-intercept. This can be applied to
					many contexts, especially in such as carrying capacity and initial
					population. This program graphs the approximate population growth of
					the human population on earth according to the logistic curve
					approximation. </p>

			<p>In an instance with limited resources such as this one, the differential
				equation dy/dt = ky(M-y) is used. y_0 is the initial population, y is the
				population after t years, M is the carrying capacity, and k is a specific
				constant utilized in modeling the growth rate. The solution of this
				differential equation is y = (y_0*M)/(y_0 + (M-y_0)*e^(-k*M*t)). With
				the data that the earth's human population was approximately 7.550 billion
				on July 1, 2017 and 9.633 billion on July 1, 2018, and that the carrying
				capacity is estimated to be approximately 9.5 billion, the k constant
				can be solved. With this, the population approximations for various
				years can be determined.</p>
