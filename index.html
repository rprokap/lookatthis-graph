			<h1>population modeling with the logistic curve model</h1>
			<p>given dy/dt = ky(1-y/M), the logistics differential equation,
				general solution is y = M/(1 + be^(-Mkt)), where M is the carrying
				capacity, b is a constant that controls where the curve
				crosses the y axis, and a = M/(1+b), or the initial value/y-intercept.
				this can be applied to many contexts, especially in
					such as carrying capacity and initial population. given 3/4
					of the variables, it is possible to solve and graph this
					curve, which is what this program does.</p>
